After selection, each selected Smart Cities have to set up SPVs and start implementation of their Smart City Proposal, preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs), tenders etc. The SPV will convert the Smart City Proposal into projects through Project Management Consultants (PMCs) and implementation thereafter.",

      "1": "The objective is to promote sustainable and inclusive cities that provide core infrastructure and give a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and sustainable environment and application of 'Smart' Solutions.",
      "2": "The focus is on sustainable and inclusive development and the idea is to look at compact areas, create a replicable model which will act like a lighthouse to other aspiring cities. The Smart Cities Mission is meant to set examples that can be replicated both within and outside the Smart City, catalysing the creation of similar Smart Cities in various regions and parts of the country.",
      "3": "Some of the core infrastructure elements in a Smart City would include adequate water supply, assured electricity supply, sanitation, including solid waste management, efficient urban mobility and public transport, affordable housing, especially for the poor, robust IT connectivity and digitalization, good governance, especially e-Governance and citizen participation, sustainable environment, safety and security of citizens, particularly women, children and the elderly and health and education.",
      "4": "The strategic components of the Smart Cities Mission are city improvement (retrofitting), city renewal (redevelopment) and city extension (Greenfield development) plus a Pan-city initiative in which Smart Solutions are applied covering larger parts of the city.",
      "5": "Area-based development will transform existing areas (retrofit and redevelop), including slums, into better planned human settlements, thereby, improving liveability of the whole cities. Development of well-planned and fully serviced new areas (greenfield) will be encouraged around cities in order to accommodate the rapidly expanding population in urban areas. Application of Smart Solutions will enable cities to use technology to improve infrastructure and services.",
      "6": "Comprehensive development in this way will improve quality of life, create employment and enhance incomes for all, especially the poor and the disadvantaged, leading to inclusive cities."

  "missionChallenge": {
    "heading": "Smart Cities Challenge",
    "para1": "In 2015, the Union Ministry of Urban Development announced the Smart Cities Challenge. The challenge aims to create exemplar areas in cities by merging innovative plans with latest technologies. By creating these replicable exemplar areas it aims at redefining the way city is imagined in India. The Challenge aims to find solutions for the major problems of the cities by merging innovative plans and latest information technologies. It aims to improve economic opportunity, quality of life and ensure public accountability. In short, it aims at making life in the cities smarter and faster.",
    "para2": "The Smart Cities Mission proposed a two stage selection process. In 2015, in the first stage of the challenge only Kochi got selected from Kerala though the state nominated six other cities including Thiruvananthapuram. Thankfully Kochi got selected in the final list of twenty states. To win the Smart City challenge, the cities chosen for challenge have to present project proposals developed in consultation with public and various other stakeholders. The mission stresses the use of information technology and social media to reach out to various sections. Once selected, the city will receive Rs. 500 crore from the centre in a span of five years to implement the proposal while the city administration and state government has to finance an equal amount. Though Thiruvananthapuram was not selected among the first 100, fortunately it was selected again for competition in May 2016. This has once again opened a chance for Trivandrum to finally prove its mettle and become a Smart Thiruvananthapuram. Smart Thiruvananthapuram is the bold response of the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation and its people to the challenge thrown at it by the Smart Cities Challenge. By taking this challenge up, the city corporation aims to remake the life and image of the city and create a city of a better future."
